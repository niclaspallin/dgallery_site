## Gallery Site with Django

#### Description:
Easily add, update, and remove images and albums.

#### TODO:
* [x] Create a modal that will contain big pictures.
* [x] Make the slider display current index in the dots below.
* [x] Design a first draft of a proper list view for albums. Display a preview thumbnail from the album, in the list view.
* [ ] Make album covers be automatically generated from django admin, alternatively generate a "image grid" in css with a collection of ~3 images of different sizes.
* [ ] Add buttons "next" and "previous" into the image modal.
* [ ] Make the pages more responsive
* [ ] Use case: As an administrator, enable inserting multiple images at the same time into a specific album, adding a lot of different images, one at a time, could be very time consuming.

#### Developer notes:
* CSS classes are prefixed with 'z-' in order to avoid collision with external libraries.

#### Versions:
* Python 3.6.5
* Django 2.0.7
